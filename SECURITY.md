- Provide as much detail as possible:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact
  - Suggested fix (if any)

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **7 days**.
- Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed with high priority.
- When a fix is available, we will release an update and credit your contribution if you wish.

## 🚫 Out of Scope

Please note the following are **not considered vulnerabilities**:
- Missing security features (e.g., 2FA in the app)
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies (unless exploitable directly in this project)
- Issues that require root/server-level access outside the scope of this repo
