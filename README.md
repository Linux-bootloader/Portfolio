# üöÄ Flask Portfolio App

This is a Flask-based portfolio application.  
This README explains how to run the app **locally for development** and how to **deploy it in production** using **uWSGI + Nginx**. It also covers integration with **Cloudflare Tunnels** if you don‚Äôt want to expose ports directly or set up DNS/SSL manually.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` & `venv`
- (Production) `nginx` and `uwsgi`

---

## üîß Local Development

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linux-bootloader/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app locally:

```bash
flask run --debug
```

By default this starts the app at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## ‚ö° Production Deployment (uWSGI + Nginx)

### 1. uWSGI Configuration

Create a file (e.g. `myproject.ini`) inside your project:

```ini
[uwsgi]
chdir = /path/to/your/project
module = app:app

master = true
processes = 2
threads = 2

socket = 127.0.0.1:8000

vacuum = true
die-on-term = true
virtualenv = /path/to/your/project/env
```

Test:

```bash
uwsgi --ini myproject.ini
```

---

### 2. Nginx Configuration

Create `/etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        include uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:8000;
    }

    location /static/ {
        alias /path/to/your/project/static/;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico {
        alias /path/to/your/project/static/favicon.ico;
        access_log off;
        log_not_found off;
    }
}
```

Enable and reload nginx:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now requests to `yourdomain.com` will be proxied to your uWSGI app.

## üåê Using Cloudflare Tunnel

If you do **not** want to open ports or manage your own SSL certificates, you can use [Cloudflared Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/):

1. Install the client:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install cloudflared
   ```

2. Authenticate with your Cloudflare account:

   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel login
   ```

3. Create a tunnel:

   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel create myproject
   ```

4. Map your local service to the tunnel (assuming nginx listens on port `80`):

   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel route dns myproject yourdomain.com
   ```

   Or run locally without DNS:

   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:80
   ```

Now your app is available on a public URL via Cloudflare Tunnel, without exposing open ports.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Service Management (Production)

### systemd Service

Create `/etc/systemd/system/myproject.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=uWSGI instance to serve Flask app
After=network.target

[Service]
User=youruser
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/project
Environment="PATH=/path/to/your/project/env/bin"
ExecStart=/path/to/your/project/env/bin/uwsgi --ini /path/to/your/project/myproject.ini

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable myproject
sudo systemctl restart myproject
```

Check logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u myproject -f
```

---

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

- **404 (Not Found) for static files**  
  - Make sure nginx block uses `alias /path/to/.../static/;` (with trailing `/`).  
  - Ensure your HTML references `/static/...`.

- **403 (Forbidden) for static files**  
  - Ensure permissions allow nginx to read the folder:  
    ```bash
    sudo chmod -R o+r /path/to/project/static
    sudo chmod o+x /path /path/to /path/to/project
    ```

- **502 Bad Gateway**  
  - uWSGI isn‚Äôt running or crashed. Check with:  
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status myproject
    ```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Use `flask run` during local development.  
- Use **uWSGI + Nginx** (or a container setup) in production.  
- Use **Cloudflare Tunnel** to securely expose your app without public port-forwarding.  
- Link static files consistently via `/static/...`.
